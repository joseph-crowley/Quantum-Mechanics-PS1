\subsection{}
\textit{Show that an operator $\hat{A}$ that satisfies any two of the following conditions: (i) $\hat{A}$ is unitary, (ii) $\hat{A}$ is Hermitian, (iii) $\hat{A}^2 =\hat{1}$, also satisfies the third. }
\subsection{}
\textit{Show that the product of two unitary operators, $\hat{U}_{1} \hat{U}_{2},$ is also unitary.}
\subsection{}
\textit{Demonstrate that the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of any unitary operator commute with one another, so that a unitary operator can always be diagonalized. What are the properties of the eigenvalues of a unitary operator?}
\subsection{}
\textit{Show that an operator of the form $\hat{U}=\exp (i \hat{H})$ is unitary, if $\hat{H}$ is an Hermitian operator.}
\subsection{}
\textit{Consider two operators $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{A}^{\prime}$ which are related by a unitary transformation,} 
$$
\hat{A}^{\prime}=\hat{U} \hat{A} \hat{U}^{\dagger}.
$$
\textit{Show that $\operatorname{Tr}\left(\hat{A}^{\prime}\right)=\operatorname{Tr}(\hat{A})$ and $\operatorname{det}\left(\hat{A}^{\prime}\right)=\operatorname{det}(\hat{A})$}
